# Data and code from "The developmental trajectory of object recognition robustness: children are like small adults but unlike deep neural networks"

This repository contains data and code from the Paper "The developmental trajectory of object recognition robustness: children are like small adults but unlike deep neural networks"
In this paper we conducted a psychophysical experiment to thes the object recognition of children and adults (aged 4--36).
